DNS:- Domain Name System

HTTP:- Hyper Text Transfer Protocol 

WWW:- World Wide Web

HTML is the triad of cornerstone technologies for the web.
The skeleton - HTML
The appeareance - CSS
The brain - JavaScript

Hyper Text Markup Language is used for coding the actual content of webpages.

CSS:- Cascading style sheets is the language used to style websites.

HTML is constructed with lots of elements. These elements are simply the building blocks of HTML pages.
HTML Elements:- Headings, Paragraphs, Lists and many more.

Tags:- When a HTML document is read, it is the element tags which determine the type of content displayed.

Weather it be HTML, CSS, or Javascript you can make comments in your code this is both notes for yourself, and other developers.
depends on which document type you are writing there are slight different ways to make the comments.
Example:- <!-- this is where comments go --> this is how to comment in HTML
/* This is where the comment go */ this is how to comment in CSS comments
// This is comment for Javascript

Unordered Lists
<ul>
    <li>list 1</li>
    <li>list 2</li>
</ul>

Ordered Lists
<ol>
    <li>list 1</li>
    <li>list 2</li>
</ol>

Attributes are the properties for HTML tags

<tag Attributes>content if required</tag>

<a href="https://wearecodenation.com/">Code Nation</a>

<a href="https://wearecodenation.com/" target="blank">Code Nation</a> this will open the link in a new blank tab 
rather then open the link in the current page.

Three ways to insert CSS
Inline style
Internal style sheets
External style sheet

Inline style would override the other styles and browser defaults.
Use external style sheet so it tidier

Always start from top to bottom, keeping your HTML and CSS in sync.

CSS rules are formed using a list of properties which we give values (quite similar to key-value pairs in JavaScript objects)

CSS rules apply a list of properties to specific HTML elements, which we target using selectors.

CSS selectors they are used to find the html elements based on their tag name, id, class, attribute etc.

Styling can also be applied to the whole html.

Style everything at once *{} or body {}
Element selector h1 {}
ID selector #about me {}
Class selector .container {}
Group selectors h1, h2, p {}

/*css comments*/
/*this is
a multi-line
comment*/

ID can only be used once, cannot start with a number
Classes you can add as many as required.

Box sizing model - design and layout

Content - where text and images appear.
Padding - clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent.
Border - A border that goes around the padding and content.
margin - clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent.


CSS flexbox layout - New layout module in CSS3 to improve items alignments, directions and order
in the container, dynamic or unknown size.

flexbox will try to work with the width you set, if impossible it will evenly distribute the boxes.

Ordering can help with setting the order of items you wish to disply, whilst keeping the original ordering in the html file.

CSS Transition and Animation

A transition has a clear start and end state, moving from one to the other.

We use transitions when we want our css rules to change.

CSS transitions
1. Moving elements across the screen
2. Changing the size of elements
3. Changing an elements' shape
4. Combine all of the above

CSS Animations

CSS Animation are similar to transitions.

With CSS animation we can specify lots of different CSS style changes.

There isn't necessarily a definite start and end point (like trabsition) and we can write
them using something called Keyframes.

@Keyframes yourAnimationName {
    0% {
        property: value;
    }
    100% {
        property: value;
    }
}
