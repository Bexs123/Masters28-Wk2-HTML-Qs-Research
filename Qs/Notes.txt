HTML is constructed with lots of elements. These elements are simply the building blocks of HTML pages.

Three ways to insert CSS
Inline style
Internal style sheets
External style sheet

Inline style would override the other styles and browser defaults.
Use external style sheet so it tidier

Always start from top to bottom, keeping your HTML and CSS in sync.

CSS rules are formed using a list of properties which we give values (quite similar to key-value pairs in JavaScript objects)

CSS rules apply a list of properties to specific HTML elements, which we target using selectors.

CSS selectors they are used to find the html elements based on their tag name, id, class, attribute etc.

Styling can also be applied to the whole html.

Style everything at once *{} or body {}
Element selector h1 {}
ID selector #about me {}
Class selector .container {}
Group selectors h1, h2, p {}

/*css comments*/
/*this is
a multi-line
comment*/

ID can only be used once, cannot start with a number
Classes you can add as many as required.
